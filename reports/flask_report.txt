Flask Report

--What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?

Using Flask allows us to implement certain web framework features in a simple way that would have otherwise been much more complex to implement. In our specific case, 
we use Flask in our Python files to redirect users to different paths on the site using redirects and routing.

--How does this technology accomplish what it does?

Route: https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/03db9194d8d229d04e6a37b14bbe2499d23922d5/src/flask/scaffold.py#L370

Flaskâ€™s route function works by using a decorator to decorate a view function that registers it with the URL that is passed in as a string parameter. The decorator function in route 
calls add_url_rule which is used for registering a rule for routing incoming requests and building URLs.

Redirect:
Returns a response that redirects the user to the target location that is passed into the redirect function as a URL parameter.
